## What is pywerami

pywerami is a stand-alone program to make an countour/3D plot from data
file generated by the Perple_X program WERAMI or tci file generated by
TCInvestigator.

## Installation

You need Python 3.10 or later to run pywerami. The package requires [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), and the plotting routines require [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

It is suggested to install pywerami to isolated environment.

### Create a Virtual Environment
Open any terminal and run below command:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment. For Linux based OS or macOS:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows with cmd:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

For Windows with Power shell:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

To install astropy from PyPI, use:
```bash
pip install pywerami
```

### Using conda/mamba
For  (virtualenv or conda)
Another recommended way is to use [Miniforge](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html),
the minimal installers for [Conda](https://conda.io/) and [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) specific to
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), with the pre-configured conda-forge channel as the default (and only) channel.

To create own isolated environment, open Miniforge terminal and run.
```bash
mamba create -y -n pywerami python>=3.10 pyqt=5 numpy matplotlib scipy
   ```

Activate the environment:
```bash
mamba activate pywerami
```

and install pywerami:
```bash
pip install pywerami
```

To start pywerami, simply type:

```bash
pywerami
```

Do not forget that virtuakl environment must be activated prior running `pywerami`.
